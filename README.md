# KHET-E

## Inspiration
According to the UN, Nearly 1/2 of all fruit & vegetables produced globally are wasted each year. With decreasing energy and resources across the planet, **Khet-E** is made to promote better yield among farmers and better health among malnourished people and animals. Also, we know that it might be difficult for farmers to use websites, we have integrated the functionalities of this website in the form of a WhatsApp Bot as well in order to reach a greater target audience.

  ## What the Card Does
	The card for Augmented Reality-
  When the AR card is scanned, the user is directed to any one of the of four symbols that represent valued services:
	The webpage of Khet E.
	Crop Recommendation, Fertilizer Recommendation, and Disease Prediction are all included in this module.
	The bot for WhatsApp.
	The locust tracker is a map that shows where the locusts are.

App Engine- We used App Engine for Deployment of our project.App Engine is a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. You can choose from several popular languages, libraries, and frameworks to develop your apps, and then let App Engine take care of provisioning servers and scaling your app instances based on demand.We deployed our python Flask App on Google Cloud which will enable us to scape up easily according to our needs.

Google Maps API- We used Google Maps API for the map feature of our app.Google Maps API is a set of application programming interfaces that lets us talk to its services. It will allow us to build simple apps to very sophisticated location-based apps for Web, iOS, and Android.It allowed us to easily integrate map in our project.It is very much easy to deploy than other alternatives such as MapBox.

Machine learning is one of the emerging technologies in Artificial intelligence that provides the ability to learn, infer, recorrect, and relearn from the experience gained. The robustness of Machine learning and Deep learning can be highly utilized in any domain especially for agriculture related production system. The accuracy and the strength of these algorithms helps the farmers to take appropriate decisions and supportive actions. 
The work has concentrated on vital part of the agriculture that has a drastic impact on farming and farmers. This paper presents a detailed explanation on five categories. They are :

## (A) Crop Yield prediction to increase the nourishment of the crops using Machine learning algorithm that checks the nutrients of the crops, soil fertility,provides suggestions to grow crops depending on the geographic location and the amount of rainfall received,

## (B) Fertilizer recommendation with respect to the species and crop recommendation,

## (C) disease prediction in crops and livestock

## (D) Locust Attack Prediction.
What are locusts?

Locusts are the oldest migratory pests in the world, according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).These insects differ from ordinary grasshoppers in their ability to change behaviour and form swarms that can migrate over large distances. The most devastating of all locust species is the Desert Locust (schistocerca gregaria), according to the FAO.The locusts, which are considered to be among the most dangerous pests known to humanity, reproduce fast — 20-fold within three months — the FAO experts noted.An adult locust can eat quantity equal to its weight daily, and just a single square kilometre of the swarm can contain up to 80 million adults, they said.Locusts can fly up to 150km daily and a one square km swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day.If not controlled, desert locusts can damage food supplies and cause famine. Some 45 million sq km of land in 90 countries are potentially prone or under the threat of invasion by the desert locust, according to the FAO.Hence this function is incredibly useful and beneficial to farmers since it records the locusts' movements and notifies and directs them in the direction in which they are going, allowing farmers to securely maintain track of their harvests.

## (E) Our B2C model sales and purchase support.

Application of artificial intelligence in farming and farm management provides enriched experience and recommendations to the farmers that helps them to take appropriate actions without wasting time, resources and energy.



## How we built it

✅ Website is built using a html, css, python, flask, streamlit and machine learning models.  

✅ Built crop and fertilizer prediction model using random forest classifier and xgboost.  

✅ Built disease prediction model using image segmentation using resnet.  

✅ Integrated a Google Map for the nearest nursery.  

✅ The WhatsApp Bot is built using Twilio and python and the solutions are provided using all the models developed for the website.  

✅ The B2C section was build using MERN stack.

✅ The locust prediction was build using different Machine learning models such as logistic regression,XGBTree,K-nearest neighbour,Log-Linear model.

✅ The Augmented Reality was build using Unity and Vuforia.
